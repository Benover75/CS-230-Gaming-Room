# CS 230 Module Eight Journal - The Gaming Room

## Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Requirements
The Gaming Room was a fictional client requesting a software system for managing and running turn-based games across multiple platforms. The goal was to design a scalable and reusable application architecture for a game called "Draw It or Lose It".

## What I Did Well
I clearly documented the system architecture, class diagrams, and explained the design decisions. I focused on modularity and scalability.

## Helpful Aspects of the Design Process
Designing the document helped clarify the application's structure before coding. It allowed me to see the components and their relationships clearly.

## What I Would Improve
I would refine the use case descriptions and add more user interaction diagrams to improve clarity.

## Understanding User Needs
I translated the client's request into clear technical features. Considering user needs ensures the final product is both functional and user-friendly.

## My Software Design Approach
I used UML diagrams, pseudocode, and modular design. In the future, I will also incorporate agile storyboards and client personas.
